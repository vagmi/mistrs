An example of using Mistral RS

This is an experiment to use mistral.rs for running local inference instead
of using llama.cpp. This has both examples for in-situ quantization as well as
loading GGUF models.

There is a poem about the solar system generated by `CapyBaraHermes-2.5-Mistral-7b` 
model.

```
In vast celestial seas, a cosmic dance transpires,
Nine grand celestial bodies, in balance they align.
From legends born, a tale of life and light,
Each planet's story, forever to unite.

First, the mighty Sun, with fiery heart,
A star of life that never takes part.
In fiery embrace, the terrestrial three,
Mercury, Venus, Earth, their mysteries.

Mercury, the swift and elusive cape,
Dancing near the Sun, in swift escape.
Venus, the radiant evening star,
Bejewels the night, with beauty afar.

Earth, our cradle, cradled in the Sunâ€™s birthright,
Home to life's mysteries, both dark and bright.

Four giants next, in gas and ice adjust,
Jupiter, with storms that outstretch,
Saturn, ringed and noble, a sight to behold,
Uranus, blue and distant, ice and cold.

Neptune, the last, a mythic blend,
In realms of icy mist, it does descend.
Together, they dance across the sky,
A symphony of worlds, vastly high.

Now, to Pluto, the dwarf orb so loved,
Though not a planet, as we once believed,
In the Kuiper Belt, it still revolves,
A cherished part, of our cosmic limbs.

So ends our tale, of nine, and one in heart,
A cosmic ballet that will never part.

I got about 50 tokens per second on my MBP. I used the Q4_K_M model.
